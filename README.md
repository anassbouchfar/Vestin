# Vestin 
In the context of 48-hour Fintech Hackathon sponsored by BMCI and HPS under the theme "ESG & Fintech: What future for investment?" , we created Vestin . 

We were a team of 5 ENSIAS 1st year engineering students participating in such a challenging Hackathon. The purpose of our participation was to get initiated with design thinking, creating a business model, designing a logo, prototyping a platform, making a demonstrative video and finally pitching in front of judges and chief innovation officers. Not to mention, all of this wouldn't be possible without the help and guidance of our amazing mentor Youssef Koun. 

Our project idea was named "VestIn". It was actually an investment platform that aimed to teach the investment in the moroccan stock market using virtual money (tokens).

The particularity of this platform is that it was like a game, there were competitions and people could learn while enjoying the gaming experience.
